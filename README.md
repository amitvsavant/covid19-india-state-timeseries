## Acknowledgements
This dataset is created and maintained using the data available in public domain. The state-wise COVID-19 cases in India are published by [Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India](https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) A snapshot of the data on the above website is taken at 11PM IST(UTC+05.30) daily and appended to this dataset. 

Part of the data for initial period is taken from [India Today COVID-19 Tracker]( https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/coronavirus-cases-in-india-covid19-states-cities-affected-1653852-2020-03-09)

Thanks to Jose Cherian for his post [Kaggle API â€“ The Missing Python Documentation](https://technowhisp.com/kaggle-api-python-documentation/) on Techno Whisp. This helped me write the Python script to upload the data daily to Kaggle.
